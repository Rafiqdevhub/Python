- Dictionaries
- Sets
- String Formatting

### Featured Projects

#### 🏦 Bank Account Management System
A complete banking system implementation demonstrating OOP principles:
```python
# Example from challange/bank_account.py
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_holder, initial_balance=0):
        self.holder = account_holder
        self.balance = initial_balance
```

#### 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors Game
An interactive command-line game with multiple implementations:
- Using loops (rock-scissor-paper-game/loops.py)
- Using recursion (rock-scissor-paper-game/recursive.py)
- Using closures (rock-scissor-paper-game/closures.py)

#### 🤖 Chatbot Implementation
A simple chatbot showcasing:
- Natural language processing basics
- User input handling
- Response generation

#### 🎯 Guess My Number Game
An arcade-style number guessing game demonstrating:
- Random number generation
- User input validation
- Score tracking

   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Required Packages
```
# Key packages from virtual_envirnmont/requirements.txt
requests>=2.28.0
python-dotenv>=0.20.0
qrcode>=7.3.1
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- pip (Python package installer)

## 💡 Code Examples

### High-Order Functions
```python
# Example from High_order_functions/map.py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)
```

### Object-Oriented Programming
```python
# Example from oops/inheritance.py
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"
```
